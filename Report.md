## LinearRegression
Linear regression aims to minimize the MSE

# Validating the model

Metrics:
- The *coefficients* is a list, where the first element indicates how flight delay changes by chosen attributes
- The *intercept* is a ..
- Loss function = MSE(Mean Square Error) = (observed values - model values)^2
- RegresionEvaluator: mae(mean absolute error), r2 


## CrossValidation
CrossValidation allows us to compare different machine learning methods and get a sence of how well they will work in practice. 

Rather the spliting the data in 75/25 crossvalidation separates data into the "blocks" and uses one at the time,and summarizes the results obtained in the end.
